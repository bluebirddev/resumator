# Resumator

To install:
```
yarn
```

Add a user to the `src` directory, just like `cj.jsx`.

Instead of importing `cj` into `App.tsx`, import your user.

To see how the resume will look, run:
```
yarn start
```

To generate the resume pdf, run:
```
yarn generate WHATEVER_YOU_WANT_THE_TITLE_TO_BE
```
